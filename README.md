# arillo/silverstripe-deepl-translator

Adds Deepl translation API to a Fluent translated SilverStripe CMS.
For now it only adds UI-Elements to texty fields (TextField, TextareaField, HTMLEditorField) to translate their contents.

## Installation

```
composer require arillo/silverstripe-deepl-translator
```

## Configuration

Create a Deepl API key and add it to your `.env`:

```
DEEPL_APIKEY="<YOUR_DEEPL_APIKEY>"
```

If you are using the glossary feature, it is necessary, to set a unique name prefix in your `.env`.
It will prevent old glossaries from deletion if their names do not start with that name prefix.
This is handy if you are using the same API key in multiple instances (e.g. dev & prod).

```
DEEPL_GLOSSARY_NAME_PREFIX="myky-dev"
```

Configure your DataObjects to display the Deepl translation handles.

**NOTE:** It is important, that this configurations happens **AFTER** fluent was added to these DataObjects. Otherwise the UI will not appear.

Let's assume you have the following fluent config, named `myfluentcms`:

```
---
Name: myfluentcms
After: 
 - '#basei18n'
 - '#fluentcms'
 - '#fluentcms-pages'
---
SilverStripe\i18n\i18n:
  default_locale: de_CH

Arillo\Elements\ElementBase:
  extensions:
    - 'TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentVersionedExtension'
```

## Field-wise translator

Apply the deepl config after `#myfluentcms`:

```
---
Name: mydeepl
After: 
 - '#myfluentcms'
 - '#silverstripe-deepl-translator'
---
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  extensions:
    - Arillo\Deepl\FieldWiseTranslationExtension

Arillo\Elements\ElementBase:
  extensions:
    - Arillo\Deepl\FieldWiseTranslationExtension
```

## Alternate field value gathering for field-wise translator

To preload current values for field-wise translations this module uses the following method `$record->{$fieldName}`.
However, it is possible to specify an alternate data source by implementing a class method called `deeplFieldValueFromRecord` to overwrite the default behavior, e.g.:

```
    // in some DataObject class
    // ...

    public function deeplFieldValueFromRecord($fieldName)
    {
        switch ($fieldName) {
            case 'AOLink_Title':
                return $this->LinkObject()->Title;

            case 'AOLink_URL':
                return $this->LinkObject()->URL;

            default:
                return $this->{$fieldName};
        }
    }
```

## DataObject-wise translator

@todo description

- automatically translates all translatable fields of a DataObject
- define relations that also will be translated

```

Name: mydeepl
After: 
 - '#myfluentcms'
 - '#silverstripe-deepl-translator'

SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  extensions:
    - Arillo\Deepl\DataObjectWiseTranslationExtension

Arillo\Elements\ElementBase:
  extensions:

```




## CMS

In CMS you have to add `USE_DEEPL` permission to non-admin groups.
