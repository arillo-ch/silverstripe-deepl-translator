# arillo/silverstripe-deepl-translator

Adds Deepl translation API to a Fluent translated SilverStripe CMS.
For now it only adds UI-Elements to texty fields (TextField, TextareaField, HTMLEditorField) to translate their contents.

## Installation

```
composer require arillo/silverstripe-deepl-translator
```

## Configuration

Create a Deepl API key and add it to your `.env`:

```
DEEPL_APIKEY="<YOUR_DEEPL_APIKEY>"
```

Configure your DataObjects to display the Deepl translation handles.

**NOTE:** It is important, that this configurations happens **AFTER** fluent was added to these DataObjects. Otherwise the UI will not appear.

Let's assume you have the following fluent config, named `myfluentcms`:

```
---
Name: myfluentcms
After: 
 - '#basei18n'
 - '#fluentcms'
 - '#fluentcms-pages'
---
SilverStripe\i18n\i18n:
  default_locale: de_CH

Arillo\Elements\ElementBase:
  extensions:
    - 'TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentVersionedExtension'
```

Like this it is possible to apply the deepl config after `#myfluentcms`:

```
---
Name: mydeepl
After: 
 - '#myfluentcms'
 - '#silverstripe-deepl-translator'
---
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  extensions:
    - Arillo\Deepl\TranslationExtension

Arillo\Elements\ElementBase:
  extensions:
    - Arillo\Deepl\TranslationExtension
```

## Alternate field value gathering for field-wise translator

To preload current values for field-wise translations this module uses the following method `$record->{$fieldName}`.
However, it is possible to specify an alternate data source by implementing a class method called `deeplFieldValueFromRecord` to overwrite the default behavior, e.g.:

```
    // in some DataObject class
    // ...

    public function deeplFieldValueFromRecord($fieldName)
    {
        switch ($fieldName) {
            case 'AOLink_Title':
                return $this->LinkObject()->Title;

            case 'AOLink_URL':
                return $this->LinkObject()->URL;

            default:
                return $this->{$fieldName};
        }
    }
```

## CMS

In CMS you have to add `USE_DEEPL` permission to non-admin groups.
